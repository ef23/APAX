(* Definition of election timeout: a randomized time set for a node at the start
 * and when it transitions from candidate => follower.
 * This is BOTH the period of time a node spends as a follower before starting
 * an election as a candidate (during which it can receive heartbeats from the
 * leader) AND the duration of election. Basically changed every term. *)
